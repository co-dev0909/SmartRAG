# 🚀 SmartRAG

**SmartRAG** is a terminal-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using [LangGraph](https://github.com/co-dev0909/langgraph). It routes user queries through a custom flow that includes message history, query transformation, and document retrieval from a vector store.

## ⚙️ Setup

Follow the steps below to get SmartRAG up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/co-dev0909/SmartRAG.git
cd SmartRAG
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
choco install wkhtmltopdf  # for HTML to PDF conversion (Windows only)
```

### 4. Environment Setup

Copy and edit the `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to include:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
URLS=url1,url2         # Optional: URLs to fetch as PDF
GET_WEB_PAGES_TO_PDF=True
CONVERT_PDF_TO_MD=True
INTERMEDIATE_PDF_DIR=./pdfs
DATA_DIR=./data
```

### 5. Process Your Documents

```bash
python modules/processDocs.py
```

> ⚠️ Make sure to update `.env` parameters based on your use case.

### 6. Run SmartRAG

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User query** is passed into a LangGraph workflow.
2. **Message history** is cached and contextually enriched.
3. If needed, input is transformed for better retrieval.
4. Documents are pulled from a **vector store** using similarity search.
5. GPT model generates a context-aware answer.
